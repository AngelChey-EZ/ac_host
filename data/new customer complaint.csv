My employer, the XXXX XXXX, offers a loan repayment program and Sallie Mae had not filled out a form that I sent them in XX/XX/XXXX. It had been 5 months. Because that issue was addressed, I paid form XXXX of my loans to be deferred until my form went through. The Sallie Mae employer told me the date that repayment would begin, XXXX XXXX, and played by the consent recording, where the date was played again, XXXX XXXX. I agreed and paid the {$50.00}. 
On XXXX XXXX, while trying to refinance my loans, I was told that my loan was in delinquency status because a payment was due in XXXX. I pushed the Sallie Mae employee on why this was changed without notifying me and that I and my XX/XX/XXXX account manager set up a XXXX XXXX deferment pay date. She flippantly apologized for the mix-up, but stated that she could n't do anything to fix it. She said that she would notify her superiors. That employee 's name is XXXX XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, I called Sallie Mae again, and the employee I spoke to actually reviewed my account and noticed that there was a mistake, and said that it would be fixed. It has not been fixed. And my loan refinance provider requires a statement from Sallie Mae where my loan is not in delinquency status. And if Sallie Mae had not made their error, I would not be in delinquency status because I would be in deferment. But because they made their error and refused to fix it, I now have to pay for XXXX payments to get out of delinquency just to refinance my loan ( rather than pay for none ). And my fear is that Sallie Mae will continue to drag this process out until it is past my agreed upon ( XXXX XXXX ) deferment date, and then say, "" Well, it 's moot now, '' and force me to pay before I can refinance my loans. 
This is the quintessential definition of fraud, a deliberate deception and unwillingness to rectify an error in a timely manner until it is too late.

Today I discovered that Navient XXXX charged me on my monthly payment leaving me -900.00 in my bank account and costing me {$50.00} in overdraft and cancelation fees. When I called to inquire about this I spoke with a very rude representative who offered nothing but blame and accused me of erroneously paying XXXX. 

What in fact happened was the automatic payment plan I am in was charging my account on the scheduled date every month. When XXXX XXXX 2015 came, no payment was taken out. When I noticed no payment had been applied to my account I went online to make a payment manually on XXXX XXXX. I did this and thought everything was taken care of. I checked back in a few days to discover that still, no payment had been applied to my account. I called Navient to get to the solve the issue and I was told that the account information I used when I paid manually was from an old account, which explains why my manual payment did n't go through. I was assured I could pay over the phone with the correct account information and it would be instantaneously applied to my account.

However what the woman at Navient failed to mention to me was that they were still going to charge me using the automatic, reoccurring payment system.

I called Navient and they refused to do anything for me other than recommend that I call my bank and put a stop payment. This cost me 30.00 on top of the 25.00 over draft fee. Navient seems to continuously keep unorganized records and has a severely scattered work flow and lack of communication with their customers.

I have been using WU for over 15 years and have a Gold card ( # XXXX ). I sent {$300.00} on XXXX/XXXX/15 to a high school friend XXXX XXXX, XXXX for an urgent medical matter ; the transfer was done via telephone with my debit card, which I have used many times in the past.

I spoke with a few reps at WU including, XXXX ( rep id XXXX ), XXXX ( a supervisor ) and XXXX ( in the XXXX Support department ), but my efforts proved futile and circular. 
Amidst the rudeness, impatience and XXXX customer service, what I could decipher from the incoherent explanations from the WU staff was that for some reason further verification was needed and that my phone number was inconsistent/incorrect/unverifiable. This is troubling on many levels : XXXX, verification was already done on XXXX/XXXX/15 when I was provided the MTCN ; XXXX, if it was n't, why was it not done and why wait 5 days until I call to report non performance on their part before they bring that up ; XXXX, I provided my phone number on XXXX/XXXX/15 and they already have it on their system as it is my main number and what I used to make the call on the said date ; XXXX, WU has already debited my account and are in possession of the funds, while refusing to honor the agreement by remitting it to the receiver ; lastly, there was no urgency exhibited by WU 's staff to right a wrong/error as chronicled here. As I was on the phone to WU, the line was "" conveniently '' cutoff a XXXX of times and I was passed from XXXX rep to another until I was jaded and moved on to do other important things like my job. 
Even after I reported this matter to WU 's corporate office on XXXX/XXXX/15, there still was no urgency to perform the service that I paid for and for which they were already delinquent. I had to gather another {$300.00} to send through a different money transmitter, while WU dilly-dallied.

At the time of writing, WU is still to return my money ; they claim that they delayed my transaction for compliance reasons. If this is not an egregious breach of trust and contract, I do n't know what is.

Apparently, later that evening or Monday morning the overdraft protection transferred {$46.00} to checking. But, since that money was already transferred - by me - my savings reflected a - {$46.00} balance. 
I did n't realize this until today when I also noticed, for the last XXXX days ( and it would have continued had I not transferred money ) that PNC was charding me {$7.00} a day ( my balance in savings as of this morning was - {$60.00}. 
How can they charge me for a situation they created? Why would their system allow a transfer from an account that had {$0.00}. I feel it is unfair and a complete money grab.

05/19/2015,APR or interest rate,,"I had opened a Chase Freedom credit card with Chase. I also had XXXX other accounts related to this company. On XXXX 2015 statement it clearly identifies that the 0 % promotion was still active and that it was going to be expiring in XX/XX/2015. That is all that it showed ; it did not give a specific date indicating the promotional expiration. 

I paid the card off in full by the due date and thought everything was ok ; I paid off the 0 % balance. 

Then in XX/XX/XXXX statement they charged me XXXX in interest charges. I tried contacting the company and XXXX "" supervisors '' ( XXXX and XXXX ) refused to refund the interest charges. They then claimed that the promotion expired on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and that their interest charge was valid. If that were true ; why did the statement generated on XXXX/XXXX/2015 still indicate that there was still a promotion and still showed XX/XX/2015 as the expiration date?!?!?! 

Not only is all of this misleading I think this company is trying to take as much money from people as they can. This is the XXXX company that has ever done something like this and I do n't think I am the only person who they are doing this to. I pay off my credit cards every month and I also pay off my 0 % balances. 

As of today XXXX/XXXX/2015 I have closed ALL ACCOUNTS with Chase. Even a recently opened Amazon account. They lost a customer over XXXX interest charges ; that just tells me this company is working under false practices and does not care about their customers. 

I would like for this company to be investigated as much as possible. It is not right what they are doing. On a final note ; I know that cancelling the cards will affect my credit score .... but I am willing to take that hit and separate myself from a corrupt corporation. 

I will be uploading my XXXX and XXXX statements. Keep in mind when reading them that they indicated to me over the phone that the expiration was XXXX/XXXX/2015 ; but, nowhere does it state this on the statements. And in XXXX statement the notes in regards to the promotional balance are gone ; which if the expiration was truly XXXX/XXXX/2015 then it should have been removed from the statement generated XXXX/XXXX/2015 as well.

My other XXXX bills/trade-lines are paid, always are. But because I was sick and needed help that XXXX time I should be punished after the fact, and for XXXX more years as well?

Not to mention they also led me to believe that my loans covered my entire schooling (which they did not and XXXX.). Long story short, I eventually was contacted by a collection agency by the name of XXXX and told I had to pay XXXX more per month to them for this XXXX private loan that was sent to collections all while still paying on the other loans. I was confused and upset. I disputed XXXX but then began paying this company XXXX a month for fear of them ruining my credit. I was very young when I made this choice to start paying them and I feel now like this was predatory in nature. Then after paying for nearly a decade I assumed that I would be close to paying them off (now XXXX) and figured I would give them a call. All of this having gone on without any legal correspondence (not XXXX letter mailed to either of my addresses that I had lived in that time), only to find out the balance hadn't been dropped but a measly XXXX. I was furious and demanded records of my payments, and a copy of my original contract. I received these things and found that all of my payments had been marked as ""attorney""payments and there was no breakdown of principal, interest or collection costs...   just attorney payments. I did some research and found that there were many things going on that were not only unfair but appeared to be illegal. I called them back, informed them that I had looked into this and was told it was not XXXX but the original lender who drafted this. When I called granite state management the refused to speak with me. I again called XXXX and told them I would settle the debt for XXXX. The original loan was for XXXX, I was told my balance was XXXX after paying for more than XXXX years and that they would settle for no less than XXXX. I then finally got a letter informing me I could dispute the debt in writing. So I did just that. I received a call from a different collection agency regarding this matter and explained the whole thing to the gentleman on the phone, he agreed that something wasn't right and said he would loom into it. I never got a call back from him, and then XXXX days ago I got a call from XXXX again. They now are telling me that I owe them XXXX!!!!???? I got quite upset at the man on the phone, he told me that he would knock it down to XXXX and settle. I told him that I wanted to take care of this debt because I want to buy a house which is why I called them XXXX. He then spun that back on me and basically said i could not buy a home because this debt would hurt my credit... As this was a recorded call I asked him if he realized that it was illegal for him to say that to me and he asked me how? I understand this is a small amount of money, and I also understand that one must pay back their debts, but had I not called them apparently id have been paying them for the rest of my life with no idea the debt was growing not shrinking.

I believe it 's unethical to offer one service, and then use a confusing, deceptive, or unclear user interface to trick site visitors into purchasing unwanted services. I 'm not an XXXX or a Internet newbie, I kept watch for such things and still missed it. 

Mistakes happen, and Experian should be required to acknowledge my mistake and refund my {$20.00}. I have a family XXXX, every dollar counts, and I 'm trying to repair my credit, not provide a target for corrupt companies that claim to care about my circumstances. 

Sincerely, XXXX

06/30/2015,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"In XXXX our loan was sold to Green Tree. We had only been with XXXX XXXX Bank for about a year ( XXXX ). We continued to pay monthly to Green Tree and in late XXXX filed Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy and reaffirmed with Green Tree. They were not included in our Bankruptcy plan. They were paid on time every month. In XXXX XXXX I received an Escrow Account Disclosure Statement. This was the XXXX XXXX I had ever received from Green Tree. It included a Deficiency Amount of {$3100.00}, shortage amount of {$860.00} for a total of {$3900.00}. I called them immediately. There were some odd things on the statement. For example in XXXX of XXXX there was {$310.00} to other. They could offer no explaination but said it looked odd so they would do another check and get back to me. I would call and check but was told it was still under review. In XXXX my payment went up to an amount I could not afford. My previous payment of {$660.00} jumped to {$850.00}. I contiued to make the {$660.00} because I had not heard any results from the escrow review and calls to Green Tree were fruitless. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from collections called me to ask for the rest of my payment. I made the difference and she promised that she would investigate. Apparently the analysis was complete but I was not given any information. She submitted it again. I continued to research on my own and found my homeowners policy had increases. I called my insurance agent. We conference called Green Tree on XXXX XXXX. I was told that my escrow account was not my concern and I had no right to request statements or verification of where the escrow money had been paid. I was told we were not talking about my money and I would not be given any other information other that the standard Escrow Account Disclosure Statement. My agent and I stated that it was my money and I have a right to know where it went.He also reworked my insurance so there would be no money coming out of Escrow for insurance in XXXX. The agent reacted rudly to my insurance agent and told him the escrow would not be reworked, it would make a difference. It should have in my opinion. The Green Tree agent was extremely condescending and she was n't the last. My requests for information concerning this large amount of money was met in the following weeks with raised voices, rude tones and speaking to me very slowly. The revised Escrow Statement arrived on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a shortage of XXXX, Deficiency amount of {$2300.00} for a total of {$3700.00}. I refinanced with another complany this month but prior to the payoff Green Tree tried to bully me into making XXXX XXXX payment. The loan was paid off XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I was never given an answer as to why my escrow did not receive a review in 7 years. My lawyer stated that since it was not part of the Chaper XXXX I should have received Escrow Statement. The phone calls, rude behavior and stress was uncalled for.

I also explained how the mortgage company lied and falsified documents. Now, here we are in 2013, and I still have the same problem. No attorney will help, but that 's ok. I am in a different phase. At the time of requesting help, the house was livable, now it is falling apart and still, no help. I have XXXX situations and need directions. First, the house deed is not in my name, went to court, judge ruled in my favour that I could not by evicted from property and not to pay rent. Second, it have been some years and because this house is not in my name, no work was allowed, not even a roof after the hurricanes past through. Now here is where I need some advice, the address that was mortgage is a vacant lot, but the house sits within the perimeters. In other words, I pay a light bill and water bill where a house should be but is not. It is a vacant lot. Now, I have not heard from Chase bank who foreclosed on the property over XXXX years ago. At one point they would send someone out to check on the property ( house ) that they believed they purchased and cut the grass. But that soon stopped. After that, there was a call from an attorney in the XXXX XXXX area that called to ask me questions concerning the signature of a family member that was not notified about any of the court proceedings that lead up to the foreclosure. He said, no wonder this file was sent to me, who is XXXX, and why her name is not on these papers. I told him the long story of what happen and that was the last time I heard from anyone. I do n't know what my options are, just puzzled. The electric and water bill is affiliated with the house, is not the address on the bill.

07/15/2015,Incorrect information on credit report,Account status,"Hello, I have a leased a vehicle from XXXX and have been making consistent and on-time payments for 5 years now. I was startled to see when I checked my credit report that there was a record of a 30+ day late payment with XXXX that was negatively affecting what has been otherwise a very good credit rating. I have never been deliquent with a payment for 15 years! After checking my checking account and seeing that no check had been cashed for 2 months I realized that I was past due and immediately called their billing agency and made payment by electronic check. I am now up to date on my payments. The problem is that I believe that I am not at fault, and that XXXX IS at fault for this late payment. Therefore, I called XXXX explaining the situation and requesting that 1 ) XXXX waive any late fees associated with the payment and 2 ) that XXXX go back to my credit report and state that I was not deliquent on any payment. XXXX was willing to do number XXXX, but they were adamant about not going and correcting my late payment on my credit report, claiming that because XXXX was not at fault, they had no obligation to do so. I then contacted Experian, and after their investigation, they did not amend my credit report either. 

I believe that XXXX is wrong, and that they are obliged by law to correct my credit report, since the reason that the payment was late was their fault not mine..I have leased with XXXX for 5 years and never missed a payment till XXXX XXXX. XXXX on the other hand has always been quite haphazard with when I receive invoices from them. Sometimes I will receive them within a couple weeks of the due date, other times just within days of the due date ( in which time I have to turn around and pay the bill very quickly ). XXXX time I even had to call XXXX and ask where my bill was as I was getting nervous that I would be late due to getting their invoice not in time to mail payment back. I also found out from XXXX that they use XXXX party entities to send out invoices and to process payments. In the case here, XXXX never sent me the invoice for the months in question, and naturally I did not pay since if there is no bill, it does not enter my mind to send a check. It would be impossible to keep track of all my bills without the invoices that the companies send me! XXXX says that it is my responsibility to pay, even if they failed to send an invoice for that month, but that does n't seem fair at all putting all that responsibility on the consumer. Even this month, XXXX claims that they sent an invoice on XXXX XXXX, and I am still waiting for the bill. Why should my credit score be damaged seriously by something that is XXXX 's fault? 

I am further frustrated by the fact that XXXX never communicated with me effectively in telling me that I was late for payment ( in which case I would have paid immediately ). The only thing they did was left a vague phone message which I did n't return because I thought it was regarding a completely different issue that I had called them about and was not urgent for an answer. I wish they would have sent me a letter or something to let me know I was late!

I have XXXX year old boys and have had inconsistent work since the tragedy in our family. Recently citi informed me that they were closing my second account. Their reason was I had entered into a payment program with them on the other account. This outcome was never presented as a possibility when I entered into the agreement. I had approached them about entering into a similar program where I would pay off the entire principal at 0 % interest. I was told by the person assisting me that due to the way my account had been closed there was nothing that could be done other than let my account go to collection. Citi advice was then to allow my credit rating to be effected negatively in the hope that I could enter into a program to pay off a debt made up mostly of usurious interest charges. This seemed unfair. I request help. Thank you.

Written lock-in agreement listed different point level from the telephone quote and I made an immediate inquiry to USAA. USAA has delayed investigating my inquiry for XXXX days. USAA now asserts that the telephone call where prices/points were quoted to me was not recorded and, therefore, it will not honor what was quoted to me by phone. 

2. USAA has declined to honor the closing date listed in the purchase contract. I have made repeated requests to have the closing date corrected, with no success. 

3. USAA has taken advantage of the fact that I am single and a XXXX-time home buyer. When initiating the application process, USAA was made aware that a ) I am young and single ; b ) I have no realtor ; c ) I am a XXXX-time home buyer.

When I did receive contact info, I received only a first name and a telephone number ( no last name or email ). Phone calls were not answered, voicemails were not returned for at least XXXX hours. Loan processor did not alert me when documents were sent to me, and since I have not gone through this process I was not aware that documents would be sent by overnight courier to me that required immediate attention.

Further, the USAA representative chastised me by asking why I had not taken it upon myself to ask the questions about rate changes/required forms/process. I replied that every USAA representative I spoke to understood that I was a first-time home buyer, so how would I know to ask those kinds of questions since everything was new to me?

They invented XXXX missing payments of arrears and double collected on those made up arrears by collecting from bankruptcy court and then charging me arrears in my loan modification. They created {$31000.00} of arrears for which there is no paper trail. They also have fake and inflated fees rolled into my loan, created by XXXX and XXXX who was sued by the State of Colorado and ordered to close due to fraudulent foreclosure charges. Additionally, Chase rolled fees into my loan ( upon which I am paying interest now compounded over 40 years ) that they admitted were double billed or inappropriately charged. They tried to just refund me the face value fee amount, not reduce the principal balance or reimburse me for the compounded interest I have paid on those fees. So, I am still paying interest on those made up fees and I have not been reimbursed for the compounded interest already paid on those fake fees. 
In my loan modification, they rolled a {$900.00} "" escrow advance '' fee into my loan ( amortized over 40 years ) when that account already had over {$1200.00} surplus. Plus, they were already billing me a monthly escrow amount that would create more surplus. So, the {$900.00} is just outright theft and also trying to collect while I am in Chapter XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, they received some sort of {$220000.00} payoff to my account that remains unexplained as well. They keep money in unapplied funds instead of reducing my principal balance, and try to make up reasons why not to refund the over collected amount in the escrow account. The abuses are many. This has created extreme wealth extraction and stress related illness. 
I have documented some of the abuses in a XXXX page letter that I attached. Also, not in the letter is years of phone calls and letters sent to Chase where they denied or ignored that there was a problem. I have found XXXX cases against Chase ( that they lost ) with similar torts to mine. So, Chase can no longer deny that they engage in practices that caused me documentable financial injury. I laid out the case with over XXXX pages of documentation. I just need help getting justice. Chase refuses to look at my documentation. They keep saying they did not get it ( via fax and mail ), they ca n't open the cd I sent them with documentation due to a virus risk, and their fax did not receive all of the pages I sent even though I have confirmation they did receive the correspondence. 

Lastly, during the most egregious account abuse, they stopped giving me mortgage statements. I have requested back statements and they only send me an aggregate account that lists transactions - not mortgage balance increases. They have refused to mathematically review my account to recalculate misapplied payments. I believe this would make over a {$200000.00} difference in the life of my loan.

When I called in to discuss the credit line ( which was substantially lower than any other card I have ) I was actually only approved for the store card, and someone can not get approved for a Macy 's amex before they open the Macy 's store card and that my application was not submitted for the Amex. They did offer to apply for the Amex over the phone, but that it would be a separate account. 

I feel like this is deceptive marketing tactic. One should not be required to open a store card in order to get a co-branded card. I also feel as its deceptive to print out at the register a receipt that says you approved for something you applied for when its a different product with out informing the customer or it reflecting on the receipt that a different product was opened than what was originally applied for. 

I also do not like the fact that the credit line can not be re-assessed by anyone manually. I was told it 's all done systemically, and based on debt to income ratio 's. my next lowest credit line is {$4500.00}, {$600.00} is just simply to low of a credit line for me to carry in my wallet.

08/11/2015,Credit decision / Underwriting,,"My wife and I received a mailing from the bank that services our mortgage ( Nationstar ). The letter informed us that our modified mortgage would be ending, and that I needed to refinance to lock in a low interest rate. When I called Nationstar, I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX, Nationstar Mortgage, ( XXXX ) XXXX, XXXXXXXXXXXX. I told him that our modification was for "" the life of the loan ''. XXXX told me that all the modified loans were for a short period of time, and would end, and that the interest rate was scheduled to increase 1 % each of the next 3 years for a total of 3 %. He further stated, that this would bring our rate from 2.65 % to 5.65 %, raising our payment {$200.00} by the third year. XXXX stated that XXXX did not want this increase to put the customer back in the same position of not being able to pay their mortgage, so they were offering this refinance option for a limited time. XXXX said they could lock us in at 4.75 %, and push our mortgage out to 30 years again. We have our signed modification that states the terms as follows : 2.65 % for the first 5 years, 3.65 % for the sixth year, and then 4 % for years XXXX to the end of the loan. It also states that we will receive {$1000.00} a year for the first five years, for a total of {$5000.00}, towards the principle ( If payments are made on time, which they have been ) XXXX told me we would not receive this {$5000.00} now, and that it would pay for the closing costs on the refinance, but we would be able to skip a monthly payment. XXXX said we had to lock in before XXXX XXXX, 2015, even though we 're only in the fourth year of our modification. At the time I spoke with XXXX, I did not have my documents on hand, and I became concerned, and had him send me the papers for the refinance. Needless to say, I was not happy with the prospect of my mortgage starting all over again at 30 years. After receiving the documents from XXXX at Nationstar, I was able to locate the paperwork for our modification. I brought everything to a Reputable mortgage professional for his advice. He asked if he could call XXXX, and when he did, he let XXXX know that we were there, and if he could put him on speaker phone. He questioned XXXX on why he was trying to get us to refinance from the terms we had, to a mortgage that would put us in a worse position. He explained the terms of our modification to XXXX. XXXX became very defensive, agitated, and at times angry. He explained he does n't get to see the terms of an individual 's mortgage. He was questioned on how he could possibly give advice to people and try to get them to refinance, if he does n't even know what their exiting terms are. I believe Nationstar calls people, "" fishing '' for those that do not know or completely understand what they currently have, get scared, and refinance into a mortgage that is clearly NOT in their best interest. At the very least, I believe this is unethical, sounds illegal, and is definitely predatory. It 's shameful to know that the XXXX does business with, is trying to deceive it 's customers, and rip them off, all the while claiming that they are trying to help.

09/07/2015,Charged fees or interest I didn't expect,,"On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I visited the TitleMax office XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX and I got an auto title loan for {$2600.00}. I signed the "" California Loan Agreement, Promissory Note and Security Agreement '' attached as "" titlemax loan XXXX '', surrendered my auto title, and I got a check in the amount of {$2600.00}. I was told the loan is a fully amortizing loan, and that I had approximately {$1100.00} in available credit. XXXX and XXXX were the employees that assisted me. I was told I had to hand deliver my XXXX payments to their office at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I drove to their offices and made my XXXX payment for {$320.00}. The payment receipt is attached in the file "" payment receipts.pdf '' I noticed that the principal balance had increased to {$2600.00} and nothing was applied towards the principal balance from my payment. I called the office and requested an amortization schedule and the attached "" XXXX XXXX Loan amortization schedule.xlsx '' was emailed to me. Apparently, the had illegally added the admin fee of {$75.00} onto the principal amount financed and used an APR of 143.88 % to calculate a payment amount of {$320.00}. The disclosed amount financed on the Federal TIL was {$2600.00} and the APR XXXX. I told them that they had violated the Truth-in-Lending disclosure. They said the APR of 143.88 % was the "" State '' APR which is calculated differently than the Federal APR. I told them that was nonsense, as the number of days used to calculate the APR is the same in every state, there is no such term as a state APR and that the federal disclosure would supersede any state disclosure regardless. They told me that they would forward my concern to corporate. Nothing was ever adjusted. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I made my XXXX payment of {$320.00} and asked to receive {$1100.00} from my remaining credit available. To loan me the amount of {$1100.00} they created a new loan contract with an amount financed of {$3700.00}, an APR of 134 %. They gave me a check for {$1100.00} and applied {$2600.00} towards the outstanding balance of the XXXX loan to pay it off. The XXXX contract is attached as "" titlemax loan XXXX ''. The California Finance Lender 's law allows payday lenders like Titlemax to charge an exorbitant interest rate such as 134 % only for loan amounts above {$2500.00}. Titlemax should have loaned me the {$1100.00} at a rate capped by California 's usury law. Instead, in order to charge me 134 % for the {$1100.00} they created a new loan for {$3700.00}, which included the admin fee in from the first loan in the amount financed, a rate of 134 % and a term of 4 yrs. The new payment amount was {$420.00}. On XXXX/XXXX/2015, I made a payment for {$420.00}. Once again nothing XXXX {$0.00} XXXX was applied towards principle. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I visited their offices.

On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy which was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX ( File XXXX ). 

Immediately after the bankruptcy filing and continuing through this year, XXXX XXXX reported this loan to all XXXX credit bureaus as "" discharged with bankruptcy ''. No collection efforts have ever been made on this loan and I, therefore, assumed that XXXX XXXX agreed with how it was reporting the loan 's status to the agencies. 

Despite often-made statements to the contrary, I am well aware that only Qualified Student Loans can survive a Chapter XXXX discharge and that this loan clearly did not meet this definition since it was for an amount more than XXXX times the cost of attending the school that my daughter was enrolled at. My daughter did not deceive anyone with respect to obtaining this loan ; she disclosed what school she was attending but no one ever questioned her as to the cost of attendance. The IRS is quite clear that "" mixed use loans '' can not be considered qualified student loans and this loan was so large that it had to be known that it would be used for purposes other than tuition, books, etc. 

For the past five years I have assumed that XXXX XXXX recognized that this loan did not survive the bankruptcy and there have been no attempts to collect on it from me. That is none until today when I was called by Northstar Location Services, a representative of which informed me that they had been directed to collect on the loan. I asked about the five years of reporting it as discharged by bankruptcy and I was told that they had no knowledge of that. I tried to explain to the representative that it is improper, unfair and probably illegal to report that a loan was discharged and then to suddenly decide to collect on it.

It is simply unconscionable to suddenly change the ground rules on a consumer after five years of taking a position that is diametrically opposite from the XXXX being taken today.

Apparently my account terms have changed now requiring minimum balances and I am being charged service fees ; however, I did not receive advance notification of these changes to my accounts. I also was informed ( after the fact ) that the bank routing number and account numbers were changing and that I was responsible for notifying billers who drafted payments from my account. I have requested new checks for my account, but the Bank has never delivered them. I have reported all of these issues to the Bank on at least 5 occasions, by telephone and in person. On at least two of these occasions, I requested a return call from the private banker who opened the accounts initially. I never received a return call. I was told on at least two occasions by representatives from the Bank that the transition has been challenging, that other customers have complained, and that other customers did not receive communications about the transition. I also was promised that the service fees removed from my accounts would be replaced. They have not been.

My complaint right now is with Chrysler Financial Corporation because I informed them what had taken place and that I was worried about how this would effect my credit. Chrysler Financial Corporation did escalate this to the office of the president and talked to the dealership but because I signed the contract there 's nothing they can do and its up to the dealership.

So I set up my direct deposit of {$250.00} twice a month to go to this account. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I realized that still have not received a promotional bonus, when I called XXXX to report this problem, she called different departments to find out what happened and they said that there was suppose to be XXXX direct deposit of {$500.00} and it could n't be XXXX direct deposits totaling {$500.00} and that I wo n't receive a bonus. If I would have known that It needs to be XXXX direct deposit I would have simply set it up that way.

You can clearly see that I did what I was explained to do. But she said that her employee would have not done that. I understand that she suppose to protect the bank assets and back up her employee, but that went a little too far. She clearly did not do any research and probably never even looked at my account to see what I was referring to.

11/12/2015,Fraud or scam,,"On Tuesday XXXX XXXX I receive an automatic email from Paypal saying that I have autorised a payment of {$100.00} to XXXX. I did not order anything at this XXXX, the organisation was unknown to me. I contacted XXXX and issued a fraud alert with Paypal. 

Fearing that my accounts had been hacked, I changed passwords on every account I could think of, including XXXX. XXXX then automatically takes you through some steps to check if everything is OK. XXXX XXXX an app that I possibly had not installed myself. It was a XXXX app, and indeed I had not installed it. 
I found out that it was impossible to notify XXXX in any way about the scam and the fact that my XXXX account was perhaps involved in this. There is *no* email address or contact form to be found. 

XXXX confirmed that the payment was made via a fraudulent account and directed me to Paypal. 

Paypal does not acknowlegde my claim. They state that the payment was done from the same location as the fraud report. Therefore, they conclude that there is not enough evidence to support my claim and charge me with the task of finding evidence. 
In all this, I have already pointed out to Paypal that my XXXX account had been tampered with ( I had different passwords for XXXX and PP ), informed them of this suspicious app and repeatedly asked how their statement compares to that of XXXX ( which does acknowledge a fraudulent account ). 

On all of my questions I just get a standard reply, Paypal does not address any of my questions. Neither do they explain how I am supposed to get evidence of a hack/fraud. 

It may very well be that the payment was done from my home. I work from home and had my computer on all morning and XXXX was open most of the time. But it is beyond me to find out, let alone prove, how this fraud was carried out. It seems to me that PP are the ones with the expertise to investigate these matters, not me.

I 've been paying for years and after 30 days of being late they just put this on my credit and I called before 30 days were up. Please help me.

01/08/2016,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"Starting in about XXXX 2015 I started wondering why my account had not gone down in 10 years. It had only gone down {$800.00} in 9 years. I had made extra payment amounts from the beginning. I made {$450.00} payments for almost 2 years. None of the extra {$40.00} made it to my Principal. ( Attached doc ) They were used just for interest. For many years I was under the impression that this loan was like any other loan - it 's a set amount and it does n't matter when you pay it as long as you are not late. I was making XXXX payments at XXXX time sometimes - little did I know that this loan does n't work that way. You have to make a payment every 30 days on the dot - or you will be charged interest since you were over 30 days. So making payments early and then making double payments actually cost me money because the next payment was not due for 45 days. So I would be charged XXXX more days of interest. I have since figured this out. I also noticed that when I would pay extra that the extra amount would be taken off of my next payment amount. ( EX. XXXX would go down to XXXX ) Eventually my monthly payment would be {$0.00} - and they would say I do n't need to make a payment. So I did n't. What they were doing was taking my extra payment amounts and showing I was prepaying interest. ( They should have gone to reduce principal ) Then if I did n't make the payment they would then charge me another 30 days interest. 
Most of my concern is that I am trying to pay this loan off in 3 years. I want to make big payments to get my principal down. So since XXXX 2015 - I have been working on this and "" testing '' the system to make sure payments are being applied correctly. I would make {$500.00} payments and those payments would all go to interest or just be applied wrong. I have attached information so you can see how they posted the payments. You will see that I had to call back and have them re-do the payment allocations - every month - they were applying my extra payments to prepaid interest. I have a script that I have to say to them each time. ( See below ) I talk to someone different every time. They do not apply the payments correctly. And this week they lost XXXX of my extra payments. I made the payment over the phone on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and the lady said it was good to go. I had to use my script near the bottom of this document to make sure she does it right. Many people have said to me "" you need to do this exactly. '' And I have done everything they have said. I got an account with them to make sure the payments were coming out on time. I also say exactly what they want me to say. I then have to go into the account the next day to see if they applied the payments correctly. Why am I working so hard to make sure they do this right? Should n't they have this? I was told multiple times from the people on the phone that they have to '' make these changes all day long. These loans are bad and the system can not handle the loans. '' They also told me to do the payments using the new Online Payment application. That system also takes my payments and then prepays the interest. This is not working either. So I went back to calling the loan servicing number. And that is when they screwed up my payment for {$280.00}. It has now been 8 days and that amount is not showing on my loan. They did take the money out of my account - but I have not seen it. They said it went into another account. Not sure if it was my account or someone else 's. I have talked to multiple people and they could not find the {$280.00}. See below the events by day. 
I did involve the XXXX. I am working with XXXXXXXXXXXand he suggested that I contact your office.

During this lapse of time I told Sallie Mae that I was experiencing financial hardship, yet they show no sympathy to my situation and forced me to repay my private loans. I had to go back to school, and this time to graduate school hoping that I would earn a diploma, which will enable me to find a high paying job. My loans were postponed yet the interest kept increasing. Consequently, when I came out of XXXX school, I was not able to pay my loans back with a meager salary as a XXXX XXXX XXXX ; since that was the position that I was able to find right after school.

01/01/2016,Taking out the loan or lease,,"XXXX, my husband purchased a XXXX Jeep Patriot from a local dealership in our area, using his truck as a trade-in towards the purchase and took possession of the new vehicle. After having the Jeep for almost two weeks, the Sales Manager of the dealership called my husband with a "" small glitch '' with the financing. At the time, my husband was receiving a small income from the SSA due to his XXXX. We both went to the dealership where we were told that he did n't have enough income for any of their lenders to finance his loan for approximately {$16000.00}. The Sales Manager insisted that we apply as co-applicants since I had stable employment and this would provide a better demonstration of being able to afford the vehicle with the combined incomes. Due to exhaustive medical bills after my husband 's XXXX, I knew my credit would have a negative impact on the application, and my husband and I requested to cancel the entire purchase - relinquishing the Jeep and asked for his truck back. At that time, we were informed the dealership had sold his truck and that we were essentially stuck with the Jeep despite not yet having a lender willing to "" buy the paper. '' The Sales Manager "" finally convinced '' Capital One Auto Finance to fund the purchase and it only increased our payment "" a little bit '' -- bringing the payment to {$480.00} per month. He produced a new sales contract and specifically instructed us to date the contract for the original date of purchase ... two weeks prior ... which invalidated and denied us with our right to a 3-day period to change our minds as buyers. XX/XX/XXXX, my husband and I were victims of a bank compromise wherein our bank account was immediately depleted of any and all funds deposited. This caused our first payment to CAPONE to bounce, and we immediately made arrangements to cure the issue. For 3 months, we made XXXX payments each month. Over 3 years later, CAPONE is still reporting us to be 180 days in arrears, destroying any attempt to rebuild our credit while juggling ongoing medical expenses and financial hardships. CAPONE repeatedly called us while my husband was in hospital, after XXXX, while in XXXX, and even when he was XXXX. We have paid late, but have paid EVERY month since being conned into what we recently found out was a lose-lose, never-ending predatory loan. CAPONE has informed us that the type of loan set up was not designed to be paid off and if it ever is, we will have paid almost 3 times the value of the vehicle over the course of the loan. We have requested to have the loan refinanced, to which CAPONE stated they do not refinance their loans. When attempting to refinance with local lenders, they have informed us that we are in a predatory loan and that due to the majority of all our payments going towards CAPONE interest revenue, very little of our payments have gone towards the principal value of the Jeep, and therefore they are unable to help us. This type of action is derelict on the part of a financial institution and not within compliance of the federal regulations in place to protect consumers ' interests. One agent with CAPONE even acknowledged that their business is aware of the faulty lending practices from the dealership but said their hands are tied and we are essentially stuck with the vehicle, the huge payment and the irreparable damage to our credit as we struggled to meet our obligation ... and then asked when she could set up our next payment for processing.

This is abusive and should be rectified by reducing the 7.5 % loan accordingly.

I did n't owe {$14000.00} nor anything near that amount. However, my husband was ill from XXXX on so I could only pay the minimum payments and when I was short on $ for his medicines ; food ; and gas ; I would occasionally pay by credit card. The interest rate kept rising and the balance was n't getting smaller. I kept telling them my situation and that I was the only XXXX working and to please reduce my rate but DC refused. I finally had to stop making payments in XXXX so that I could pay for my husband 's medical bills. 
While trying to figure out how to fight the lawsuit, I XXXX XXXX "" lawsuits against Discover Card '' and found the Joint Consent Order Docket # XXXX ; FDIC XXXX & XXXX XXXX. I read how DC was supposed to automatically refund their customers for the "" safety products '' without anyone contacting for reimbursement or reduce the amount from amount owed. I was never notified that there was a lawsuit against DC and I was never reimbursed for the deceitful business practices by DC. I remember calling DC every month to stop charging me for these "" safety products '' but they never did. Finally, when they posted that last XXXX, it put me over the limit, then they charged me an over the limit fees! 
Early on, DC also habitually charged late fees of {$39.00} even when I was n't late. I realize that they were doing this until after about a year of helping my mother-in-law when she passed away from XXXX. I called DC many times during my lunch break to have the late fees reimbursed. The refused. Finally, they removed 1 months worth but refused to go back to the prior year. 
I asked for copies of my statements that were blocked from me by DC and asked them to go back as far as XXXX. They went back to XXXX but some of the months were missing, so I still do n't know how much more they owe me. Also, every time I filed papers in court I had to pay fees ( I did n't have a lawyer because I am a widow since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and am on a limited income ). The judge did tell me that DC had the burden of proof to show the court that I owed {$14000.00}. The court date was scheduled for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. A week before the court date, their attorney tried to get me to sign an agreement that I would n't sue DC and not to tell anyone about the agreement, etc. I asked if DC would improve my credit report because my credit was in the toilet but their attorney was n't very encouraging. The more I thought about it, the more upset I was getting. So I contacted their attorney and told them : "" DC could n't follow a Federal Court order, why would you think that they follow an agreement signed by me? I will see you in court! '' ( I did n't sign it. ) The day before the court date, their attorney e-mailed that they were dropping all charges against me and were cancelling the court date. 
I believe they owe me for all the safety products that I did n't ask for {$550.00} - could be more since some statements were missing ; late fees ( approximately a year worth= {$460.00} ) ; over the limit fees {$110.00} which was their own fault for charging the fees in the first place ; all the court fees I paid = {$550.00} ; not to mention the toner, postage ; paper ; and for pain and suffering for this year of XXXX that I went through - I would say whatever the maximum the court allows {$2500.00} - {$5000.00}. 
They never did send me the application I signed, because if they had I am pretty sure that it did not say that "" someday DC will charge you 29.99 % ''. Because if it had, I would have ran straight to the shredder! 
I never did have my way in court so that the judge could rule in my favor! They sued me for {$14000.00} but the statements did n't show the charges! DC expected me to pay them for the next 47 years minimum payments of {$300.00} which would come to {$160000.00}!

04/01/2016,Fraud or scam,,"On or around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I ordered my son a personalized gift card from Wells Fargo Gift Card Services in the amount of {$150.00}. I was told it would take 10-14 business days for the card to arrive. 

I paid for the gift card with my Wells Fargo Visa charge card. My card was charged for the purchase on or around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells to inquire about the card, as I had not received it. I was having it mailed to me, rather than my son, to include it with other gifts for his birthday. I was told to give it another week. 

I waited another 10+ business days. I called the card services center again. I was told "" that card is lost, you will not be receiving it.. we need to cancel that card and order a replacement card '' ... so I did.. On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I called to inquire about the replacement gift card, I was told that I would receive it any day. 

I received the card. I mailed it via XXXX to my son.. On XXXX XXXX, my son called to tell me that he attempted to activate the card. He got a recording that said "" thank you, this card has been cancelled ''. Turns out.. the initial card I had ordered did arrive and that is the card that I mailed to him ... the replacement card never arrived ... 

As a result, I went to XXXX XXXX and wired my son the {$150.00} cash as a replacement for the intended gift card. 

I then cancelled the XXXX gift card, which still had not arrived .... and never did arrive. 

Another phone call to Wells, the Rep informed me that since I was cancelling the gift card purchase, I would pay a {$15.00} cancellation fee. A check would be issues to me, in my name, rather than my son 's, and it would take 3-5 weeks. The refund check never came. 

I called sometime in XX/XX/XXXX to inquire, I was told the refund was requested, but never issued. It was to be issued to me right away.. Again ... I was the purchaser, so the refund was to come to payable to me ... for {$130.00}, rather than the {$150.00} purchase price, because I cancelled the order.. Oh my ... OK. 

The refund check came payable to neither me, nor my son.. It is made payable to XXXX XXXX XXXX. So ... on or around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I called and explained that the check was to made payable to myself, XXXX XXXX. Additionally, my son 's name is not XXXX XXXX XXXX, his name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, and that the check is issued to a XXXX address, while my son 's address is in XXXX. 

I was speaking to a supervisor named XXXX. He said that he completely understood, would reissue the refund, waive the {$15.00} cancellation fee, issue in my name, as I was the purchaser, and mail it to me. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I called to inquire about the replacement refund check. I again spoke to XXXX who told me that early in the month, the replacement check was denied. That they could not change the name. 

I have a check that I can not do anything with ... I have called the gift card service center approx. 10 times in the course of 3 months. 

I have a check made out to the wrong person, for a gift that I paid for, by which I replaced out of my pocket. 

I am out {$150.00}, I have a check made payable to someone that does n't exist in the amount of {$130.00}. 

I have paid for the gift card, paid for the XXXX XXXX wire fee to replace the gift that I did not send my son, been penalized {$15.00} for the cancellation, and am stuck with a check that I can do nothing with.

I have never dealt with this company and do not know how it has my information. Additionally, the card was sent to the temporary address where I am living, which makes me even more suspicious of the company and the offer. A XXXX search showed many other complaints about this company and the fees charged for everything from checking your balance to using the money you load or have deposited on it.
